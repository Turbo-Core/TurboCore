# TurboCore
TurboCore will be a blazing fast, reliable, and scalable Backend-as-a-service written in Rust.

## Why Rust?
Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. It also has a very active community and is used by many large companies such as Mozilla, Dropbox, and Twitter.

## Why BaaS?
Backend-as-a-service is a new trend in the industry. It allows developers to focus on the frontend of their application and not have to worry about the backend. It also allows developers to quickly prototype their ideas without having to worry about the backend.

## Why Actix?
Actix is a high performance, asynchronous, and lightweight web framework written in Rust. Since TurboCore needs to blaze through requests, Actix is the perfect fit.

## What is the status of TurboCore?
TurboCore is currently in the very early stages of development. A roadmap will be created soon.

## How can I contribute?
YOu can contribute by reporting bugs, suggesting features, or even writing code. If you want to write code, please try to follow the [Rust Style Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/README.html). If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue.
