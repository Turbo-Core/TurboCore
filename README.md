# Documentation
Documentation is being worked on along with the code. You can find the current documentation [here](https://docs.turbocore.org). **Note that the documentation is not even close to being complete, and more will be added as the project progresses.**

# Feature Requests
We welcome all feature requests from the community with open arms. If you have a feature request or a suggestion, you can create an issue on our GitHub repository. When creating an issue, please provide a clear and concise description of the feature or suggestion. This will help us to better understand what you are looking for and to implement it in a more efficient manner.

## Why Rust?
Rust is a systems programming language that runs insanely fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. It also has a very active community and is used by many large companies such as Mozilla, Dropbox, and Twitter.

## Why BaaS?
Backend-as-a-service is a new trend in the industry. It allows developers to focus on the frontend of their application and not have to worry about the backend. It also allows developers to quickly prototype their ideas without having to worry about the backend.

## What is the status of TurboCore?
TurboCore is currently in the very early stages of development. A roadmap will be created soon.

## How can I contribute?
You can contribute by reporting bugs, suggesting features, or even writing code. If you want to write code, please try to follow the [Rust Style Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/README.html). If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue.
