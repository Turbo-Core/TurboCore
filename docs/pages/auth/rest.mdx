# REST Endpoints

## Introduction
It's reccommended to use one of the client libraries, but if for some reason you can't use them, TurboCore provides a REST API for authentication. You can use this API to sign up, sign in, and log out users. You can also use this API to get a user's information and refresh their JWT token.

<Callout emoji='ℹ️' type='info'>
    Endpoints that require authentication will be marked with a 🔒. See [Using the REST API](/using-the-api) for more information.
